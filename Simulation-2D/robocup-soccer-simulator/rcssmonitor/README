============
INTRODUCTION
============

The RoboCup Soccer Simulator Monitor (rcssmonitor) is used to view the
simulation as it takes place by connecting to the rcssserver or to
view the playback of a simulation by connecting to the
rcsslogplayer.

===========
QUICK START
===========
From the rcssmonitor directory execute:

`./configure'
`make'

This will built the neccesary binaries to get you up and running.
`rcssmonitor/src/rcssmonitor' is the binary for the monitor.

===========
CONFIGURING
===========

Before you can build The RoboCup Soccer Simulator Monitor you will
need to run the `configure' script located in the root of the
distribution directory.

The default configuration will set up to install the monitor
components in the following location:

/usr/local/bin			for the executables

You may need administrator privilages to install the monitor into
the default location.  This locations can be modified by using
configure's `--prefix=DIR' and related options.  See `configure
--help' for more details.

The monitor has serveral features that can be enabled or disabled at
configure time by using the `--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]' or `--disable-FEATURE'
parameters to `configure'.  `--disable-FEATURE' is equivlant to
`--enable-FEATURE=no' and `--enable-FEATURE' is equivlant to
`--enable-FEATURE=yes'.  The only valid values for `ARG' are `yes' and `no'.

========
BUILDING
========

Once you have successully configured the monitor, simply run `make'
to build the sources.

==========
INSTALLING
==========

When you have completed building the monitor, it's components can
be installed into their default locations or the locations specified
during configuring by running `make install'.  Depending on where you
are installing the monitor, you may need special permissions.

============
UNINSTALLING
============

The monitor can also be easily removed by entering the distribution
directory and running `make uninstall'.  This will remove all the files that
where installed, but not any directories that were created during the
installation process.

====================
