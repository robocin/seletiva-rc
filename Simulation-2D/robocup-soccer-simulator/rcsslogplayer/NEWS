[13.1.1]
  * Fixed gcc-4.4 compilation problems. Thanks go to Hedayat Vatankhah
    providing the patch.

[13.1.0]
  * Added a new command, 'rcgconvert', that can convert any version of
    rcg files. rcg3to4 and rcg4to3 has been removed from a release
    package.

[13.0.1]
  * Fixed build problems on some platforms.

[13.0.0]
  * Supported a monitor protocol version 4 and a game log version
    5. Now, these versions are used by default.

  * Supported a stamina capacity information and its drawing.

  * Now, the classic log player is dispabled by default. If you want
    to use it, please try `./configure --enable-classic'.

[12.1.2]
  * Fixed compilation problems with gcc4.3. Thanks go to Hedayat
    Vatankhah for providing the patche.

[12.1.1]
  * Fixed a bug of the team_graphic painting for right side teams.

  * added an auto-quit mode option.

[12.1.0]
  * Reimplemented rcsslogplayer using Qt4. Please note that Qt 4.1.0
    or later is required to build the new logplayer. You can disable
    to build the new logplayer by './configure --disable-qt4'.
    The new logplayer supports the qmake build system. If you have
    troubles with Makefile generated by the configure script, please
    try 'qmake && make'.

    - The new logplayer supports a standalone mode. Now, rcsslogplayer
      can show the game status without rcssmonitor.

    - The new logplayer can be used as a simple monitor client. This
      also means that rcsslogpalyer can be used as a simple proxy
      server.

    - The new logplayer supports the Windows environment.

  * Renamed old logplayer to rcsslogplayer_classic. You can disable
    the classic logplayer with 'configure --disable-classic'.

  * Reimplemented the rcgparser library.

  * Added new commands, 'rcg3to4' and 'rcg4to3', that are the simple
    game log version converter.

[12.0.0]
  * Supported a game log format version 4.

[11.1.1]
  * Fixed a X11 library configuration problem on some platforms.

[11.1.0]
  * Just updated a minor version number. Official relasese for the
	RoboCup2007.

[11.0.3]
  * Fixed a defect of the wrong library linking in the
    rcgparserexample. Thanks go to Ralf Berger for reporting the
    problem.

  * Fixed a replay speed in the rewind and forward mode.

[11.0.2]
  * Fixed a bug in the command line parsing.

  * Fixed a flicker while the stop mode.

[11.0.1]
  * Reimplemented as a memory based log player.

  * Added 'rcgsplit' command, that can split a large game log file
    into the several segments.

[11.0.0]
  * Supported 64-bits OS.

  * Supported a gzipped log file.

  * Fixed build problems on some platforms.

  * Renamed a parser library name to librcssrcgparser.

[10.0.1]
  * Ported to OS X

  * Fixed compilation error during "src/netif.C".
    The error is caused by changes of "rcsbase/net/addr.h".

[10.0.0]
  * Fixed bug in rcg2xml and in it's schema.  The output now validates
    without error.  The schema can be found at

      http://sserver.sf.net/xml-schema/rcg/rcg-0.1.xsd

    and it is also included in the distribution.

  * rcg2xml now generates and xml file for the entire source file.

[9.3.4]
  * Fixed some the #includes in the rcgparser library

  * For those of you using autoconf and automake in your own
    projects, ac_lib_rcgparser.m4 has been added for easy detection
    of the rcgparser library.

  * For those of you wishing to create your own parsers, an example
    has been added in rcgparserexample.  Feel free to copy this code
    and modify it to your hearts content.

[9.3.3]
  * The rcsslogplay script now reports errors if the logplayer or a
    monitor cannot be found.  The script has also been modifed to use
    the monitor specified by the RCSSMONITOR enviroment variable as the
    default monitor (this can be handy of you use your own monitor or
    wish to change the default to the classic monitor).  If RCSSMONITOR
    is not set, the script will try to use either rcssmonitor or failing
    that, rcssmonitor_classic.  At anytime you can override the default
    by using the -frameview and -classic options.  Finally, the script
    now allows any number of parameters to be passed to rcsslogplayer.
    If -frameview or -classic is specified in the parameters, it will be
    removed from the parameters before they are passed to rcsslogplayer.

  * The log player now provides a very basic rcg parsing library.

  * A tool (rcg2xml) to convert rcg files to xml has been added.  It
    reads the rcl file from stdin and output the xml to stdout.  Only
    version 2 and 3 rcg files are supported.  It also only permits
    the first 100 cycles to be outputted.  This is to create
    small(ish) files for testing purposes.

[9.3.2]
  * The log player now uses the rcssnet library for all networking.

  * The log player can now compile with either sstream or strstream.

[9.2.4]
  * Fixed linking defect on Solaris plaforms, where the xnet library
  is required

[9.2.0]
  * Fixed warnings with gcc3.2

  * The log player will now compile on systems that do not have X or
    when X is disabled (--without-x in configure's arguments) and will
    run in no window mode in those cases.

  * Actually fixed library problems on Cygwin this time.

[9.1.5]
  * Fixed library problem on cygwin

[9.0.2]
  * Fixed problem compiling on Solaris 8

[8.05]
  [rel_6]
  * Added support for new playmodes
