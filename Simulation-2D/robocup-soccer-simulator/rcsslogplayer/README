============
INTRODUCTION
============

The RoboCup Soccer Simulator LogPlayer (rcsslogpleyr) is a game log
replay tool for the RoboCup Soccer Simulator Server (rcssserver).

===========
QUICK START
===========
From the rcsslogplayer directory execute:

`./configure'
`make'

This will built the neccesary binaries to get you up and running.

`rcsslogplayer/qt4/rcsslogplayer' and
`rcsslogplayer/classic/rcsslogplayer_classic' are the binary for the
log player. To be able to run, the binaries need to find shared
libraries which created when you build rcsslogplayer. This means you
must either intall the log player (make install) or run it from
`rcsslogplayer/qt4' or `rcsslogplayer/classic'.

A sample game log converter command can be found at
`rcsslogplayer/src/rcg3to4', `rcsslogplayer/src/rcg4to3',
`rcsslogplayer/src/rcg2xml' and `rcsslogplayer/src/rcgsplit'.

To see a game log with the classic log player, you will need to start
a simulator monitor, which needs to be installed seperately
(rcssmointor or rcssmonitor_classic).

===========
CONFIGURING
===========

Before you can build The RoboCup Soccer Simulator LogPlayer you will
need to run the `configure' script located in the root of the
distribution directory.

The default configuration will set up to install the log player
components in the following location:

/usr/local/bin			for the executables

You may need administrator privilages to install the log player into
the default location.  This locations can be modified by using
configure's `--prefix=DIR' and related options.  See `configure
--help' for more details.

The log player has serveral features that can be enabled or disabled at
configure time by using the `--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]' or `--disable-FEATURE'
parameters to `configure'.  `--disable-FEATURE' is equivlant to
`--enable-FEATURE=no' and `--enable-FEATURE' is equivlant to
`--enable-FEATURE=yes'.  The only valid values for `ARG' are `yes' and `no'.

========
BUILDING
========

Once you have successully configured the log player, simply run `make'
to build the sources.

==========
INSTALLING
==========

When you have completed building the log player, it's components can
be installed into their default locations or the locations specified
during configuring by running `make install'.  Depending on where you
are installing the log player, you may need special permissions.

============
UNINSTALLING
============

The log player can also be easily removed by entering the distribution
directory and running `make uninstall'.  This will remove all the files that
where installed, but not any directories that were created during the
installation process.
